# bracket

This Python application was originally created to settle a debate between friends on the best Western animated film.
Questions were compiled by picking 128 memorable films, and then creating forms concerning which of two films was better.

The results were then tallied with NumPy and used to create a unique "score" for every film.
Each "win" over a film was a point, each "loss" was a lost of a point.

The results were then visualized with Pyglet to provide an interactive window that details every single film and the breakdown of their scores.
The final scores were then plotted with Matplotlib with the respective scores on Rotten Tomatoes.
